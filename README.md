# jts-xysplit

Sometimes we have some large problems and we think that it would be great to split these problems to some computers and solve them.

jts-xysplit can split your geometries with a naive, but functional algorithm. jts-xysplit split your geometries on X and Y axis and merge results.

Here there is a small sample.

```java

public class R {
  
}

```
